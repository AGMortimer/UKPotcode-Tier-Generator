# UKPotcode-Tier-Generator
A UK postcode COVID 19 tier lookup

This code works to assign the tier assigned by the English government to postcodes in England. It will take any UK postcode, but if not in England it will return the country name instead of a tier. Please note that this will only work when the tier system, and website, is live.
As this is a web-scraping project, when any changes are made to the website, there is a strong chance that the code will need amending.
